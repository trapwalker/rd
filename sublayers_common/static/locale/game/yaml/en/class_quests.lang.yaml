But I'll teach you one trick to get experience faster. Each car is ranked according to its performance. It's five stars in a vehicle's specifications. The higher the mileage is and the larger number of enemies was destroyed by the vehicle, the more stars it has. The number of stars defines the amount of experience you gain for killing and how much loot you'll find in the trunk of your fallen enemy. Moreover, the experience points gained by someone destroying your vehicle also depend on the number of stars. So your task is to show me a tested five-star vehicle!"

Trust the words of your mentor, this world is not ruled by guns and cars, but by associations of people. As in the ancient war the Cro-Magnons beat the Neanderthals, so today a numerical superiority and discipline outweigh everything: it's all the same whether your car is more expensive or cheaper, your gun is first-rate or not; for a real leader, it doesn't matter.

And even if it's not there — make money! Go and barter 30 times with people like you. Try to make those barters as profitable for you as possible. This is the most primitive type of trade, but it will give you an idea of the psychology and mechanics of the value exchange. The barter window is opened by clicking a light bulb in the upper right corner of the Nuke Commander when you approach someone. Remember to turn the combat mode off!"
